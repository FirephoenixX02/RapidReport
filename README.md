# RapidReport
RapidReport is a versatile reporting plugin designed to streamline reporting tasks, offering features such as GUIs and report history, requiring installation solely on the Proxy server.
As far as I'm aware, it's the only plugin offering these capabilities.
Other plugins typically require installation on all backend servers, which, in my opinion, renders the existence of a Velocity Plugin redundant.

# Dependencies
RapidReport requires [Protocolize](https://github.com/Exceptionflug/protocolize) aswell as the [legacy data module](https://ci.exceptionflug.de/job/Protocolize-Legacy-Data/) from Protocolize.
